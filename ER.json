Their manor lies not far beyond this point. When the Raya Lucaria Academy turned on the Carians, the Knights of the Cuckoo descended on this tract. After leveling it, they carried on to the manor. The Carians were taken off guard, but their strength had not waned, and they repelled the knights' onslaught...By conjuring an enchanted snare that remains potent to this day.

And pray for your success. My apologies for the misleading words of warning. I never imagined that an audience, let alone service to Lady Ranni was in your fate.

Oh, no, wait... How did I not see it before? I ought to retire as war counsellor for such a gross oversight! Let me explain. The fate of the Carian royal family is guided by the stars. As is the fate of Lady Ranni, first heir in the Carian royal line. But General Radahn is the conqueror of the stars. Who stood up to the swirling constellations, halting their movement in a smashing victory. And so, if General Radahn were defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement.

Good of you to drop\u00a0by. Have you heard? Lady Ranni has departed on her journey. Along the dark path of the Empyrean, from Renna\u2019s Rise, as she calls it.

But if Lady Ranni, as an Empyrean, reists being an instrument of the Two Fingers, the shadow will go mad, transforming from a follower into a horrid curse. But such is his destiny. In such matters, Blaidd's own thoughts hold no weight. It pains me so, but he must be neutralised.

How unfortunate. <disappears>", "You sadden me, my apprentice.", " For a time, I believed us kindred spirits. My apprentice...", "Ahh, a yen for glintstone sorceries? Well, your aptitude does appear...passable. But one must choose one's masters wisely.", "I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria, as a reviled, apostate witch. Do you still wish to learn from me?", "Well, you are a piece of work. Very well. You are now my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in glintstone sorcery. But I refuse to coddle. Or cast kind words. Never.", "Anticipate\u00a0grievances, young apprentice.", "Young apprentice, first things first. You are a tadpole when it comes to magic. Infantile. Without the legs to walk.", "So, to become a sorcerer, first, you must face your ignorance. Now, shall we start learning?", "Our powers draw upon the powers embedded in glintstone, but what is the nature of such power? Glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, golden amber contains the remnants of ancient life and houses its vitality, while Glintstone contains residual life. And thus, the vitality of the stars. It should not be forgotten that glintstone sorcery is the study of the stars and the life therin.", "Oh, is that a scroll? Takes me back to my academy days. Very well. This is sorcery with which I'm not entirely unfamiliar. I'll be sure to incorporate it into one of your lessons. Never lose that inquisitive spirit, my apprentice.", "It will do no good, I swear it...and yet you persist, you frothing degenerates...A...argh!", "Well, well... Seluvis is not a name I ever wanted to hear again... But, fine. If it will help you, my apprentice, I offer my knowledge. The stars alter the fate of the Carian royal family. And the fate of your mistress, Ranni. But long ago, General Radahn challenged the swirling constellations, and in a crushing victory, arrested their cycles. Now, he is the force that repulses the stars. If General Radahn were to die, the stars would resume their movement. And so, too, would Ranni's destiny.", "Ah, then you have seen Master Azur. Master Azur was a founding glintstone sorcerer, and my first teacher. A stern judge of men, but he must have seen something in you. You make us both proud. We can speak more later, my apprentice.", "If you recall, I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria. It was for attempting to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. The toothless pedantry peddled by the Carian royal family can rot for all I care. I want glintstone sorceries that open our minds, unbound by terrestrial taboos. No matter what we give in return. My apprentice. I presume nothing. Teacher and student are not bound to tread the same path. But hear me out, my apprentice. I need your help to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. Perhaps this is a journey we could take together?", "Splendid. I thank you. This pleases me. It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit. You must have a fabulous teacher.", "I need your help, my apprentice. Master Lusat is another founding glintstone sorcerer. And like Master Azur, he was banished from the academy. Now he languishes, imprisoned somewhere. My apprentice, can you find Master Lusat? With this glintstone key, you should be able to cross the boundary that encloses him.", "I need him to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. He's nigh a child of the stars, such is his body now...", "After his expulsion from the academy, I heard that Master Lusat returned to his home. A place called Sellia, in the eastern Caelid Wilds. Thinking about it, I obtained the glintstone key I gave you from a Sellian sorcerer. It wouldn't be too much of a leap to suppose he's still cooped up nearby.", "My apprentice. Give me a moment later. I have a favour to ask.", "Who could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat...You have my gratitude. This is all your work. I am truly pleased to have you as an apprentice, and a kindred spirit. This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it.", "This brings us a full step closer. The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the academy. If only I could undo these wretched shackles...", "The form you see before you is merely a projection. My body lies elsewhere. But the academy's shackles prevent it being moved. My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between, imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum. Can you make the journey to my body? I have something that I can only trust with you.\u00a0", "My apprentice, thank you for coming. These shackles take a toll on us all. There is something I need you to look after. My primal glintstone. A star has fallen, and my fortunes waver. someone may come for my life. And so, I entrust it with you. My self.", "Thank you...my apprentice... This...is my essence. Please, treat it with care.", "Treat it with care, my apprentice... What you hold is my very being...", "My apprentice, just how long has it been? Thank you. You've helped me fill a new body, once again. And it's truly a gem. Young and full of vigor, a snug fit for my Primal Glintstone. Better still, I've shed those awful shackles. Finally, I can return to the academy. To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current. My dear apprentice, I owe this all to you.", "Jerren, bringer of my death.", "You have my gratitude. For freeing me from my shackles.", "But I am afraid your work is done.", "Join the school. To reflect on your mistake.", "Ahh, my apprentice.", "You've saved my skin once again.", "Do you see this? The Queen of Caria is no more.", "With the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat returned, the academy can hone the primeval current.", "So that we, fallen children of the stars, shall beam with brilliance once again.", "My apprentice. Will you stay with us, here at the academy?", "Oh, I know it's not possible.", "You have your own calling. To be the next Elden Lord.", "But do think of me.", "Of your teacher. On the eve of your crowning.", "You will always be my darling pupil.", "Rest assured that I...", "No, the entire academy, will swear allegiance to the new monarch.", "My apprentice. Become Elden Lord.", "Hmm. Perhaps I'm jumping ahead,", "but here is a symbol of my allegiance, and the academy's.", "(gives ", ")", "Do you recall what I once told you?", "That glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, and sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein.", "When you become Elden Lord, please illuminate me.", "Lay bare the secrets of life which course the Elden Ring.", "Next time, I will be your student.", "Oh, one last thing.", "If you fail to claim your throne,", "you can always pay me a visit.", "Oh, don't fret. Even my dullest pupils will always have a place here.", "U...urgh. M-my...apprentice...I-I'm...", "(Subsequent Visits)", "There you are, my apprentice. Shall we commence the lesson?", ".", "(Talking again without reloading)", "You wish to continue the lesson? Very well, I have time aplenty."]},
