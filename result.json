I teach incantations, the strength granted us by the Two Fingers,\u00a0and explore the secrets of the Golden Order. So that one day, if a Tarnished of the Roundtable Hold should become Elden Lord, I might counsel them,ensuring order regains its proper form, righting rule over men. By the way, do you still see it? The guidance of grace. You do! Wonderful news.\u00a0Most Tarnished are blind to it these days. You are something of a rare breed.\u00a0Well, what do you say?Care to learn an incantation of the Two Fingers?Ah, you appear to be doing well. Very good. Well then, would you like to learn an incantation?That. . . is a work of heresy. Its incantations bear no lineage from the Erdtree. (sigh) Very well. . . I'll take it off your hands. This. . . is a volume of incantation. It's good to see your enthusiasm. Indeed, I will happily take it off your hands. May the Golden Order shine through you. There's something I should mention to you as well. I'm thinking of leaving the Roundtable Hold. Do you know of the noble ?Though he was a Tarnished, living outside the Lands Between,\u00a0he was a great scholar, who foresaw the coming guidance of grace. And now, I hear he has come to the Lands between alone, to contemplate the Golden Order. . . I wish nothing more than to seek his instruction, and perhaps even help him in his research. Ah, I've been waiting your return. I've decided to leave the Roundtable Hold after all. As I mentioned, I'm off in search of the noble Goldmask. We may not meet again for some time. If there's any incantations you wish to learn, now is the moment. Ah, look who we have here. How delightful, to meet a familiar face, even after departing the Roundtable Hold. I've been doing some learning of my own since then, actually. And will happily pass it along to you. I'm yet to find the noble Goldmask. I suppose he'll be closer to the Erdtree. The path ahead might be perilous, but tread it I shall. Since departing the Roundtable Hold, I've come to understand, in my solitude,how little it is I truly know. . . Do. . . do you sport with me!?From your description, it can be no other than the Goldmask himself!Of course, of course, I knew he would be close by. Bless the Golden Order, and its benevolent rays. And to you too. My sincerest thanks. Ah, we meet yet again. Thanks to you, I have become acquainted with the noble Goldmask himself,and taken my place by his side as you can see. Have no fear, I will still teach you incantations, as before. Though we must do so quietly, such that we do not disturb the great master's cogitation. The master is always deep in contemplation. While I frantically attempt to record his wisdom; the movement of his finger. And though I am yet to comprehend the daintiest morsel of his wisdom. . . I know that this, this is my life's calling. The Golden Order has bestowed me, talentless as I am, the great duty of documentarian. Master! What ever is the matter?Please, I implore you continue!Continue your reflections, your rhythms!I must be the one to record them!What matters this issue of Radagon, really?The Erdtree, heart of the Golden Order, lies before our very eyes!Why must these qualms come to you now?We were on the very cusp!Oh, was that you? Sorry, I hardly noticed. I'm a little shaken since the master ceased his movements. The master's reflections had heightened as we neared the Erdtree. While still a precise calculus, the rhythms grew increasingly wild. Until he simply ceased. Now the master is facing quite the puzzle. The Golden Order is founded on the principle that Marika is the one true god. However. . . The name of Marika's second husband, King Consort Radagon, also appeared. . . Who exactly was Radagon?The master is stumped. His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered. Curse my mediocre mind. The master only has me; and here I fail him. What on Earth did you do to the master?Well, not that I'm complaining. Master's finger moves again, resuming his cogitation; more than good enough for me. I haven't the words to thank you. So I'd like to pass this on to you instead. A glimpse into the heart of the Golden Order, documented by yours truly. To think, that Radagon was Marika herself. Or at least, such is all I can interpret from the rhythm and calculus of his finger. How would such a thing even have been possible, I wonder. Sadly, I cannot comprehend it myself. Do you have a fuller understanding of the matter?Well, either way, I can continue my documentation. In truth, it matters very little whether I understand the master's thoughts or not. I am merely his scribe. It is my sole and unwavering purpose. Ah, nice to see you. I can't believe you've come all this way. I've been gripped by a terrifying thought. The rhythms and calculus of the master's finger. . . betray a suspicion of the holism of the Golden Order. A conceit, I am afraid, that cannot be overlooked. Oh, but how could this be?I dread to even entertain the possibility. . . but somehow, I cannot cast aside my doubts about the master. Tell me, have I simply lost my head? Only, if the master were true to the Golden Order, why would he think to breach this forbidden mount of fire?Oh master, put my mind at ease. Dispel these fearsome thoughts. I want to place my trust in you, to be your scribe. It will make me forget, you say?So that I can push aside these frightful thoughts. . . Ha. . . ha ha. . . Would that I could. . . Would that I could. . . Master. . . where did you go? I'm right here. Please, show me. Your finger. Your rhythms, and calculus. . . Let me document the motions. . . Master. . . Master. . . Where did you go?Oh, it's you. I've finally come to understand. The master was nothing more than a madman. Enchanted by a vain and ruinous delusion, he rejected the perfection of the Golden Order,seeking to supplant our glorious faith with his own!Could there be a more pitiable comedy?Look at it. The culmination of perfection, burning, before our very eyes!Ha. . . ha ha ha. . . Ngh!What are you trying to achieve? Cease that!You've done it now. Faith grants me strength, that I might endure. O Golden Order, shine through me. Please don't trouble us again. O guidance. . . of grace. . . Why. . . can't I O master. . . To be ever at your side. . .

I will teach you the secret of Sellia, the town you see there.\u00a0Ah, then you're willing to lend a hand, are you? I need your help to heal a certain young girl. Her name is Millicent. You will find her beyond Sellia resting at the church atop. the cliff stricken by the rotting sickness.\u00a0First you must find the unalloyed gold needle. It's hidden somewhere deep in the scarlet swamp of Aeonia.\u00a0 Then I will tell you as promised. The secret of the town of Sellia.\u00a0Ohh, you've found the unalloyed gold needle. As promised I've detailed the secret of Sellia right here. Go on, its yours. Now, let me have a look at the needle.\u00a0The needle is repaired. Now it will forestall the rotting sickness I'm sure. Will you give it to the girl, Millicent? I will reward you in kind. Millicent rests at the church atop the cliff, beyond Sellia, the town yonder. Tended to by the witless pests who worship her, or rather, her rotting sickness, as a god. A wretched fate indeed. The poor girl, she never wished for any of this.\u00a0Do you find it peculiar? That I would show such concern for the girl? Well, I'm the one who found her. A mere babe, in the swamp of Aeonia. She is one of my dear daughters. But the rotting sickness erodes one's memory. I doubt that she remembers the first thing about me. Oh, I must be getting old. I didn't always worry so much.\u00a0Oh, you noticed, did you?Indeed, Millicent did visit this hovel of a home. It seems the memories eaten away by the rotting sickness yet remain, but faintly. However, she has no need of me, any more. No, she must embark on her journey, and stare her fate in the eye. I mustn't impede. As I've aged, I've found the best way to aid the young. . . Is to be forgotten. Please make certain that little Millicent goes unharmed. Like her mother, she has the stuff to be a great warrior,but commands only one arm, and is yet preciously young. This is a wonderful development. Thank you for your kindness. Now Millicent may fully realise her true warrior's potential. Like her beautiful mother. Green and undeveloped, waiting to flower into magnificence. What a wondrous day that will be. In truth, before her, I'd never seen a bud of such superior quality. She might very well outshine her sisters. Do you have an interest in rot incantations? Then you might like to learn something of the history. . . of Malenia, goddess of scarlet rot. \"Queen Marika and her King Consort Radagon were blessed with twin demigods, and Malenia was one of them. She was born an Empyrean, carrying the scarlet rot. An Empyrean. . . is no mere demigod. In the age of the Elden Ring, and Queen Marika, the precious Empyrean was born. A new god to forge a new Order. Since Malenia fought Radahn, and the great scarlet flower blossomed in Aeonia, I have dedicated myself to her. And to the resplendence of the Order of Rot. The cycle of decay and rebirth. \"The words of a true innocent, the dear girl. Well, perhaps this is just as it should be. Little Millicent, following in the steps of her mother, no matter what. This is their fate, after all. \"Oh it's just. . . I realised that I'd soon be saying my goodbyes to Millicent, and. . . My eyes began to well. . . She is to meet them very soon. Her sisters. And when she does, she'll be defeated, surely, and begin to flower. \"\"Which is why. . . If you happen to be present for the girl's fight with her sisters,I ask that you side with the sisters and kill Millicent. It must be done by your hand; no other. Millicent trusts you, rather deeply in fact. Sever that trust. Nurtured by betrayal, her bud will flower most vividly. When Malenia ascends to godhood, Millicent too shall be reborn. As a scarlet valkyrie. \"\"You can't tell me you don't wish to see it. The superior bud that is Millicent, becoming the finest of flowers?I beg of you, kill her. With your own two hands. \"\"We shall meet again, you and I. There are countless pests to choose from. \" (First time killing Gowry)\"We shall meet again. As many times as it takes. For you to understand. \" (Subsequent killing at Gowry's Shack after the first)\"Have you taken the lesson, now? Killing me is an exercise in futility. All is well, provided you understand. Let's just pretend it never happened, shall we?\" (Dialogue after talking to him at Gowry's Shack after he has respawned)Millicent, my daughter. Why would you take out the needle? You were so close. So very close. To becoming the fairest of all flowers. Would you disown us too? As your Mother did? We children of the scarlet rot?Millicent. . . Malenia. . .

Would you mind. . . averting your eyes for a moment? Well. That was easier than expected. But. . . why do I feel so. . . I. . . hoped to see you again. My apologies for when last we met. I fainted before I could even thank you. Everything is as you said. Since inserting the needle, the scarlet rot has ceased to writhe. Even the nightmares have abated. . . And now, thought I can scarcely believe it myself, I can move as I please. It is all thanks to you. Not that I could every truly repay you, but I would like you to have this, by way of thanks. A token, though it is.\u00a0 Ugh. Is there something wrong? Please, cease this at once. Why are you doing this? Now you've forced my hand. I will not forget what you did for me. But this day marks our farewell. I'm considering leaving. On a journey. With the needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly. . . My destiny. . . My name is Millicent. I pray fate permits us meet again. Oh, hello again. Something about this place felt familiar to me. So I decided to pay a visit, hoping to find someone here. But I've only found emptiness. Perhaps before my departure, I needed someone to say farewell to. I must focus on my journey, for which I have you to thank. I must stay strong.\u00a0I must focus on my journey, for which I have you to thank. Ah. We meet again. In truth, it's been smooth sailing, for me. The scarlet rot has stilled, since last we met. As such, I've been able to continue my journey. I realise that if I still had my sword arm, I could have aided you in battle. Now, I'm tracing the path Malenia took, after unleashing the power of the scarlet rot, during her battle with General Radahn, in the Caelid Wilds. I should like to meet her, this vanished woman. I think she's in the north. In the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree. Giving me this arm? I thank you. I am in your debt, yet again. I think, if the arm serves well enough, it might be possible for me to wield a sword again. If the arm serves well enough, it might be possible for me to wield a sword again. Perhaps, then. I can aid you in battle. Ah, we meet yet again. The arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder. It feels just like my own, even handling a sword. Perhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, but I am sure of my skill with the sword. Thus, I would have you call upon me in battle, should you ever have the need.\u00a0It is the only way that I can express my thanks. To think we'd meet in such a place. . . What could your purpose possibly. . .\u00a0No, I know well enough who you are, and what I know is good enough for me. Call upon me again in battle, should you have the need. I'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins. I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree. Indeed, I believe that is where Malenia will be found. The Haligtree is hidden somewhere in these Northern lands. Again we meet.\u00a0I can only surmise our purposes are aligned. In which case, allow me to explain myself. I am of Malenia's blood. But in what capacity I know not. I could be sister, daughter, or an offshoot. . . Whatever the case though, I am certain of a kinship between us. There is something I must return to Malenia. The will that was once her own. The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot. The pride she abandoned, to meet Radahn's measure. Thank you for lending your hand. Without your help, I could not have defeated that quartet. I feel as if I've been in your debt from beginning to end.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you. With your help, I was able to live as my own person, if only in passing. But this is where things end. I pause to even tell you, but. . . I took out the needle myself.\u00a0Tell whoever put you up to this. That if I am to flower into something other than myself, I would rather rot into nothingness as I am. Please, let me pass alone. The scarlet rot writhes now, worse than ever. Soon, I won't be more than a mound of flesh. Curse-laden. Untouchable. I wouldn't want such a thing to bring you harm. I did not expect it to end like this. But I will not forget what you have done. Ahh, how could you. . . Is this your true heart?

Luckily for you, however, there is one shining ray of hope for even the maidenless. Me. Varr\u00e9. Take care to listen. Are you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished. You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times. That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel. Mm, indeed. Grace's guidance holds the answers. It will lead you Tarnished to the path you are meant to follow. Even if it leads you to your grave. Grace's guidance will reveal the path forward, most certainly. To Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff. The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted. It's time you set off, I should think. To Castle Stormveil, on the cliff, where grace would guide you. If you seek the Elden Ring, maidenless as you are. Oh?Do you even comprehend the gravity of this choice?Very well. If you mistake kindness for frailty of heart, then perhaps a more physical lesson is in order! You will die nameless, without ceremony. What's the matter? Shouldn't you be off proving yourself, or some such? Then go on, take the hint and follow the guidance of grace. To castle Stormveil, on the cliff. And if, by chance you do find your way to the castle, you may receive a summons. To the famed Roundtable Keep. . . Ohh, well done, well done indeed.\u00a0You made it through that entire mess, all the way to Stormveil. And off you trotted to the Roundtable Hold. . . My sincerest congratulations.

They are the purported masters of the grace that guides your kind, the Tarnished. Mm, yes, pay them a visit, so that you may see for yourself. Challenge Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil, to acquire a Great Rune. Decrepit, he may be, but a demigod he remains. And of course, an inheritor of a Great Rune. Worse yet, I hear old Godrick's acquired a ferocious new toy to graft. . . So. Prepare for the worst. \"I don't need a seat\". . . Yes, I see. Perhaps it's just as well. Besides, you are maidenless. One can only do so much with the materials provided. But then again, if you should realize the error of your ways, I'm always willing to hear you out. I don't need a seatOh, have you decided to have a go after all?

Truly, naught but rambling, senile delusions. I believe, that when the Elden Ring was shattered, the Two Fingers were corrupted, their guidance; skewed. Even worse, the Fingers harbor no love for our kind. That's the part that irks the most. You don't say. Well, what a relief that must be. You may go, then. My work here is done. May the wisdom of the two fingers guide you. Oh, I have a gift for you, something fit for only the wise. A means for circumventing the draw of the Two Fingers. Give it a try, won't you? And if it please you, may we meet again. I've high hopes for you. My lambkin. Be sure to try that finger I gave you. There's no reason to dither.\u00a0Oh, lambkin, so pleased you're here.

Might I have a word, then?Your kind are meant to challenge them. To slay them. The demigods. And their god. If you remain loyal to your calling, then no matter what you do, no matter what happens to me,I will never cease to smith your weapons. Until you have one to slay a god. I knew you'd be back. Lay out your arms. Let's get to smithing. Weren't you listening? As I've always said. You came to challenge the demigods, and their god. To slay them. And as long as you do, I will always smith your weapons. It is what I wish. To smith a weapon for you to slay a god. I've upset the girl. She says that now my chains are broken, I'm free. That if I stay here, I will be ruined with the Roundtable. What use have I for freedom now? I smith weapons to slay a god. I have lived, and will die, doing so, upon this spot. Is there any other way?Use my masterpiece to slay a god. That is all that I have lived for. And my promise to Q-queen Marika. But do me a favor, and do look after the girl. I can't hold on much longer. I'm going the way of the R-roundtable. . . It was a great honor to smith your weapons during my time here. Allow me to c-call you this, just once, before it ends.

And pray for your success. My apologies for the misleading words of warning. I never imagined that an audience, let alone service to Lady Ranni was in your fate. I, for one, should have seen it, but I did not. Do forgive me, my fellow. Let us give all that we can of ourselves. Together, for Lady Ranni.\u00a0Blaidd is Lady Ranni's stepbrother. Ranni's mother, Queen Rennala, approved of him, and they played like siblings from childhood. They were always happy to have me tag along, as well. When Lady Ranni renounced her flesh, and chose the dark path of the Empyrean, Blaidd and I swore allegiance as vassals, but none of us will ever forget our earliest days together. Promise to look after Blaidd for me, will you? The man is honest to a fault. But fortunately, now he has you. Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while. Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family. An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric. No surprise he'd get wrapped up in some festival. Oh, no, wait. . . How did I not see it before? I ought to retire as war counsellor for such a gross oversight! Let me explain. The fate of the Carian royal family is guided by the stars. As is the fate of Lady Ranni, first heir in the Carian royal line. But General Radahn is the conqueror of the stars. Who stood up to the swirling constellations, halting their movement in a smashing victory. And so, if General Radahn were defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement. As would Lady Ranni's destiny. Perhaps, even, revealing the elusive path. That leads to Nokron. Go with Blaidd to the festival grounds. Should General Radahn be defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement. Perhaps revealing the elusive path to Nokron.\u00a0Ah, you've finally come. Blaidd told me everything. You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars. The General was blighted by scarlet rot and driven to madness, but not long ago he was hailed as the mightiest demigod of them all. There is no parallel to your achievement. Nor to Lady Ranni's acute judgment of character. Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened. Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave. And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron. Now the festival is over, and General Radahn is defeated. . . Jerren's duties are finally fulfilled. Though we served different masters, I could see he was truly adept in his role. Now the time has come to remind him of an old promise made. With the starts of fate set into motion, a certain sorceress is dispossessed of her immortality. . . Finally, we can be rid of a longstanding Carian weed. . . Oh, there you are. Good of you to drop\u00a0by. Have you heard? Lady Ranni has departed on her journey. Along the dark path of the Empyrean, from Renna\u2019s Rise, as she calls it. It would not have been possible without you. As Lady Ranni\u2019s war\u00a0counselor, and moreover, her childhood warden, I express my deepest gratitude. You, and only you, were Lady Ranni\u2019s true champion. My purpose is nearing its end. I've served Lady Ranni for as long as I can remember. . . It has been a long and wondrous journey. Now Lady Ranni is in your hands. I pray that you serve her well, unto the very end. I presume you've spoken with Blaidd? Very well. There is something you should know. The Two Fingers gave Blaidd to Lady Ranni, as a faithful follower. Her very shadow, incapable of treachery. But if Lady Ranni, as an Empyrean, reists being an instrument of the Two Fingers, the shadow will go mad, transforming from a follower into a horrid curse. But such is his destiny. In such matters, Blaidd's own thoughts hold no weight. It pains me so, but he must be neutralised. For Lady Ranni's sake. Unthinkable, how could Blaidd\u2026\u00a0How did he break free from his cell? No, more importantly\u2026 Blaidd became a curse that plagued\u00a0Lady Ranni, yet in madness, gave himself to her. I\u2019ve made a grave misjudgement. And I\u00a0thought myself a capable war counselor\u2026 I\u2019ll catch up with you soon enough, Blaidd. When I do, I only hope you\u2019ll accept my apology. Something else for you?Agh. Cease this treachery at once. Lady Ranni will be devastated. This is a true shame. Don't ever show your face again. Not to me. And not to my liege.",

A Great Rune of the shardbearer Morgott. Its blessing greatly raises maximum HP. This Great Rune is the anchor ring that houses the base, and proves two things: That the Omen King was born of the golden lineage, and that he was indeed the Lord of Leyndell. A Great Rune of the shardbearer Mohg. Its blessing grants a blessing of blood to summoned phantoms, and imparts a Phantom Great Rune upon successful invasion. Mohg and Morgott are twin brothers, and their Great Runes are naturally similar. But Mohg's rune is soaked in accursed blood, from his devout love for the wretched mire that he was born into far below the earth. A Great Rune of the shardbearer Malenia. The blessing of this half-rotted rune reduces the healing power of Flask of Crimson Tears. And yet, due to the infusion of Malenia's spirit of resistance, attacks made immediately after receiving damage will partially recover HP. Malenia is daughter to Queen Marika and Radagon, and her Great Rune should have been the most sacred of all. Amber egg clutched by Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon. Great Rune of unborn demigods. Perfects those who have been born anew. Children born anew by Rennala are all frail and short-lived. Imperfect beings, each and all. Item for online play. Obtained after using the Mohg's Great Rune and invading another world. Consumed upon use. Enemies inside the invaded world receive a blessing of blood, which boosts their attack power when blood loss occurs nearby. Also, your HP recovers when blessed enemies defeat a player. Rune discovered by the noble Goldmask. Used to restore the fractured Elden Ring when brandished by the Elden Lord. A rune of transcendental ideology which will attempt to perfect the Golden Order. The current imperfection of the Golden Order, or instability of ideology, can be blamed upon the fickleness of the gods no better than men. That is the fly in the ointment. Rune gestated by Fia, the Deathbed Companion. Used to restore the fractured Elden Ring when brandished by the Elden Lord. Formed of the two hallowbrand half-wheels combined, it will embed the principle of life within Death into Order. The Golden Order was created by confining Destined Death. Thus, this new Order will be one of Death restored. Loathsome rune gestated by the Dung Eater. Used to restore the fractured Elden Ring when brandished by the Elden Lord. The reviled curse will last eternally, and the world's children, grandchildren, and every generation hence, will be its pustules. If Order is defiled entirely, defilement is defilement no more, and for every curse, a cursed blessing.",

Are you here for spirit tuning?\"\"Take a look around. The Roundtable Hold is burned. Razed to the ground. Don't worry, I don't blame you. I'll continue sprit tuning just the same as before.

He's a free man, now.\u00a0It's high time he put the Roundtable behind him\"\"So Master Hewg won't listen to you, either. You have my thanks, regardless. I'll try and talk him round next time.

And if that's the case, I'm not sure there's anything we can do\"\"Ah. So it wasn't just me this happened to. . . To think he'd forget who you were, as well. I knew he'd burn himself out, old Hewg. I think we could talk him into leaving the Roundtable Hold, now. But maybe it's better that we don't. It's only proper that we respect his choice to stay. \"\"I'll remain with Hewg. He made me who I am today. I'd like to return the kindness, in whatever small way I can. \"\"Please, become Elden Lord. Hewg was always saying that you were a Lord, to him. So slay her, with the weapons he smithed. Slay the god, Marika, who cursed us all. \"\"A little while ago someone started lurking in the wing on the opposite side of the roundtable. And I can hear, from all the way over there. . . The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of\u00a0a curse. I can ever hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself. . . A plethora of spirits in an unceasing cacophony. . . I can't even imagine. How much suffering, inflicted to who knows how many souls. . . You should keep your distance, I know you're strong, but please. \"\"I suppose the Dung Eater must have left the Roundtable. I just pray nothing ill comes of this. \"\"He's back. The Dung Eater. Again. I can hear them; the spirits as they howl and lament in fear of the curse. And worse than ever, the reverberation of the twisted malison itself. But after all this time, I've started to grasp it now. I can hear, in the malison, another fearsome Order. \"\"But it isn't like last time.

They serve the Two Fingers, offering guidance, and aid, to the Tarnished. But you, I am afraid, are maidenless.\u00a0I can play the role of maiden. Turning rune fragments into strength. To aid you in your search for the Elden Ring. You need only take me with you. To the foot of the Erdtree. Then its settled. Summon me by grace to turn runes into strength. Ahh, another matter. I bequeath to you this ring. Use it to traverse great distances. It will summon a spectral steed named Torrent. Torrent has chosen you. Treat him with respect. I understand. I'm asking you to put faith in but a stranger. Yet I'm certain that we can reach an understanding. Summon me by grace if you should reconsider. This tiny golden aura is the grace of the Erdtree. This light once shone in the eyes of your Tarnished brethren. But now it is all that guides you. Or so I hear. The rays of grace, that guide you through your burden. Upon the cliff, in , is a shardbearer. A  who inherited a fragment of the shattered Elden Ring. If the rays of grace signal the castle, then the Elden Ring beckons you. As an ally by pact,. . . I pray that you are fit. . . To face the challenge presented by the Ring. Shall I turn your runes to strength? Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment. Share them with me, your thoughts, your ambitions, the principles you would follow. Me, I'm searching for my purpose given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree long ago, for the reason that I yet live, burned and bodyless. There is something for which I must apologize. I've acted the finger maiden yet I can offer no guidance, I am no maiden. My purpose was long ago lost. . . Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here, as well.\u00a0Shall I share them with you?Very well. In Marika's own words.\u00a0My Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace. With thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between.\u00a0Ye will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die. Well? Perhaps that might serve you in lieu of a maiden's guidance. Spoken echoes linger here. Words of Queen Makira, who vanished long ago. If you wish, I will share them with you. In Marika's own words. Then, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed. Return to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring. Grow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord. Lord Godfrey. Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?In Marika's own words. The Erdtree governs all. The choice is thine. Become one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it. To wallow at the fringes; a powerless upstart. The Erdtree. . . is close. Only a little further till the foot of the Erdtree, and the accord is fulfilled. It takes me back. I was born at the foot of the Erdtree. Where mother gave me my purpose. Though now, everything is lost to me. I. . . have to ascertain for myself. The reason for which I live, burned and bodiless. Your seamster, Boc. . . I see him crying, from time to time. I think he misses his mother. He wants someone to tell him he's beautiful. Does being born of a mother. . . Mean one behaves in such a manner?Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?In Marika's own words. Hear me, Demigods. My children beloved. Make of thyselves that which ye desire. Be it a Lord. Be it a God. But should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken. Amounting only to sacrifices. . . Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?In Marika's own words. O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order. Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god. Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self. Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?In Marika's own words. I declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order. Through understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased. Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past. My comrades; why must ye falter?Forgive me.\u00a0I've been. . . testing you. To see whether or not grace truly does guide you. And. . . whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails. It seems my worries were unfounded. Torrent had your measure from the very start. Whereas I merely pretended. There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance. I can take you to the Roundtable Hold. . . Gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace. . . Very well. Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment. My utmost thanks. For bringing me to the base of the Erdtree. Here, I can govern my own movement. And thus, the accord is fullfiled. I shall depart to ascertain the purpose I was given. Farewell. I shall leave Torrent, and the power to turn runes into strength, here with you. I wish you luck, in realising your ambition. You have fought long and hard. I have no doubt you will become Elden Lord. May you take the throne. Hello again, old friend. Allow me a moment to converse with you. You were unable to enter the Erdtree, no? Prevented by the mantle of barbs. The thorns are impenetrable. A husk of the Erdtree's being; that spurns all that exists without. The only way to stand before the Elden Ring. . . and become the Elden Lord. . . is to pass the thorns. My purpose serves to aid in that very act. So I'd like you to undertake a new journey, with me. To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snow mountaintops of the giants. The I can set the Erdtree aflame. And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord. (If you intend to claim the Frenzied Flame, I ask that you cease. It is not to be meddled with. It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending. However ruined this world has become, however mired in torment and despair, life endures. Births continue. There is beauty in that, is there not? If you would become Lord, do not deny this notion. Please, leave the Frenzied Flame alone. I ask you, one more time. Please, seek not the Frenzied Flame. As one who strives to become a Lord, deny not the lives, the new births of this world. Those who would are not fit to be called Lord. When the land they preside over is lifeless. Please put a stop to this madness. The Lord of Frenzied Flame is no lord at all. When the land they preside over is lifeless. \"Think not, of the kindling. I shall see to that. All I ask of you is to make the journey. To the snowy mountaintops of the giants, far above the clouds. I know. . . I'm asking you to commit a cardinal sin. But it must be done to reach the path beyond. And that is the path I wish to travel. What is your mind?\"There is something I'd like to say. My purpose was given to me by my mother. But now, I act of my own volition. I have set my heart upon the world that I would have. Regardless of my mother's designs. I won't allow anyone to speak ill of that. Not even you. Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?In Marika's own words.\u00a0Hark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds. Guidance has delivered ye through ordeal to the place ye stand. Put the giants to the sword and confine the flame atop the mount. Let a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life. Brandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree!We are almost there. The flame of ruin lies just ahead. I'm glad it was you I traveled with. I must tender my thanks to Torrent, too. Thank you, Torrent. Please continue to lend your aid. Till the end. We're almost there. The flame of ruin lies just ahead.

Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment. O Erdtree, you shall burn. Burn, for the sake of the new Lord. Thank you. For guiding me here. The one who walks alongside flame,\u00a0Shall one day meet the road of Destined Death. Good-bye. You. . . have inherited the Frenzied Flame. A pity. You are no longer fit. Our journey together ends here. And remember. . . Should you rise as the Lord of Chaos, I will kill you, as sure as night follows day. Such is my duty, for allowing you the strength of runes. Goodbye, my companion. Goodbye, Torrent. . . Lord of Frenzied Flame. . . I will seek you, as far as you may travel. . . To deliver you what is yours. Destined Death.",

And upon looking into the matter, the talk, I surmise, is of thee. Thou'rt possessed of the power, no?To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent. Ah. As I had hoped. I was entrusted this, for thee. By Torrent's former master. 'Tis a bell for calling forth spirits. Summon them with it, from ash unreturned to the Erdtree. The spirits will obey thine command but briefly, as they recall battles past. Now it is thine. To do with as thou wishest. Forgive mine intrusion, Tarnished. I doubt we shall again meet. But all the same, learn well the Lands Between. How long will it be, I wonder. . . Before the Tarnished tire of obesiance to the Two Fingers?Upon my name as Ranni the Witch. Mother's rich slumber shall not be disturbed by thee. Foul trespasser. Send word far and wide. Of the last Queen of Caria, Rennala of the Full Moon. And the majesty of the night she conjureth. Oh, again we cross paths. I believe I said my name was Renna, when last we met. It pleaseth me to see Torrent hale and hearty. . . But Tarnished, what business hast thou here?I have no memory of inking thee an invitation. I see. Quite the sleuth, aren't we. Indeed, I am the witch Ranni. I stole a fragment of the Rune of Death, and used it to forge the godslaying black knives through fearsome rite. I did it all. But sadly for thee, the cursemark thou seekest is not to be found here. I have slain the body I was born into, and cast it away. And it is upon that flesh the cursemark is carved. And why should I reveal that to thee?I performed the act not to bury the past, nor in shame of the deed,But all the same, the begging compels me not a jot. The cursermark thou seekest is not here. That is all I will say. Now, begone. Oh, is that so?Thou wouldst render me aid, is that thy proposal?Affording thyself opportunity to grope about for the cursemark's location, no doubt?Very well. . . There's nothing wrong with a well-laid scheme. What's more, if my past and past wounds beckon to thee,I am curious enough to see what thy destiny portends. . . I'll allow it. Enter my service. And good hunting to thee. Good, then I ask we proceed with haste. There is, in my service, a half-wolven warrior by the name of Blaidd. I would have thee join him in searching for the hidden treasure of Nokron, the Eternal City. I have called for Blaidd to greet thee below. Take from him the particulars. Ah, and there wilt thou find Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, also. Heed not their peculiarities; feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst. I am sure the others will be doing just the same. Speak with the three who await thee below. Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth. It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all. Ah, allow me to forewarn thee. I shall soon enter my slumber. And it will be some time before I wake. This doll's body is not without its hindrances. . . Still, I have high hopes for thee. I look forward to the good news when I arise. No reason in particular, thou claimest?Intriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this reunion. Wilt thou enter into my service?I am the witch Ranni. I stole Death long ago, and search now for the dark path. That I might one day upend the whole of it, and rid the world of all that came before. Well? Has that roused thy interest?Thou'rt a rare sort. Not many would have accepted the offer. But I require as much of those under my command. I anticipate good work from thee. [same as \"I wish to serve you\"]What hopest thou to profit?To think such was thy plot. Well, I refuse to indulge thy fantasies. I relinquished a natural death long, long ago. Well, this is a most unpleasant awakening. The depths of wickedness never fail to surprise me. I am saddened. That thou wouldst succumb to such depravity. Led astray by Seluvis, with devious tonic in hand. Didst thou think to have thy way with me?Be gone. Hapless scum. I won't have another whiff of thy rotten breath. I have spoken. Away from my sight. This is the third time, fiend. Enough of thy unbearable breath. Ahh. . . It was thee. Not Blaidd, it seemeth.\u00a0Even in my slumber, I sensed it. It is in thy possession, is it not? The hidden treasure of Nokron?My thanks. Finally, all the pieces are in place. Soon must I begin my journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread. Ah, but before I leave, I shall entrust thee with this. My thanks, for thy sterling efforts. A strange gift, perhaps, but a rare sort such as thee would welcome it, I am sure. I am certain now, fate steered us to our reunion. I must thank Torrent too, for his part. You may leave now. It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service. What is it? You may go. I, too, am to depart on a journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread. Oh? A dogged fellow, aren't we?Or is it merely thy habit, to talk to dolls?Fine. . . fine. I hadn't expected any soul to recognize me in this guise. But now the cat is out the bag, I cannot allow thee thy freedoms. Perform for me a service, as recompense. Eliminate the Baleful Shadows which prowl these lands. The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee. I will not brook disobedience in this matter. Let us speak of the past, a while. I was once an Empyrean. Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title. Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age. Which is when I received Blaidd. In the form of a vassal tailored for an Empyrean. But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers. I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away. I would not be controlled by that thing. The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since. . . And the Baleful Shadows. . . are their assassins. I turned my back on the Two Fingers and we each have been cursing the other since. The Baleful Shadows. . . are their assassins. Even when I turned my back upon the Two Fingers. Blaidd remained my loyal ally. Heh. Though he was created a vassal for an Empyrean,He was a colossal failure, on the part of the Two Fingers. Blaidd, and Iji both. . . Art willing to give too much to me. Yet they both understand. What lieth beyond the dark path. . . That I must betray everything, and rid the world of what came before. Ah, should I add thee to the list?Another one, kind of heart. As kind of heart as they. Ach, this form hath loosened my tongue. I've let slip too much. Forget what thou'st heard. Forget. So, it was thee, who would become my Lord. Perhaps I needn't have warned thee. I am pleased, however. Thou'rt a fitting choice. I go now, to the night sky. It is there I shall find mine order. I bid thee travel the path of the Lord. And once all is done, we shall see each other, once more. What hopest thou to profit?Hmph. So, this is the measure of my Lord? Perhaps it is precisely what I deserve. . . . For surrendering myself to delusion. I take it thou'st noticed? I shouldn't be surprised. I thought I might expound a little further. . . Upon the order I envision. Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night. I would keep them far from the earth beneath our feet. As it is now, life, and souls, and order are bound tightly together, but I would have them at great remove. And have the certainties of sight, emotion, faith, and touch. . . All become impossibilities. Which is why I would abandon this soil, with mine order. Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only lord?. . . The battle is over, I see. To every living being, and every living soul. Now cometh the age of the stars. A thousand year voyage under the wisdom of the MoonHere beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond. Into fear, doubt, and loneliness. . . As the path stretcheth into darkness. Well then. Shall we? My dear consort, eternal.",

If you find her, please be sure to tell me. Be sure to tell me If you meet a young woman named Lanya. She's a servant to my house.\u00a0She's been my companion since childhood. I've lost count of the number of times I've had to find her like this. Honestly, she's such a little tomboy. Lanya. . . Lanya. . . It's me Diallos. Answer me, would you?Hello, friend. Tell me if you know, would you. The whereabouts of the hidden house of those despicable fiends. The recusants who hunt their fellow Tarnished. They laid hands upon my servant Lanya, and I refuse to let the insult stand. \"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood. \"I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message. They laid hands upon my servant Lanya, and I refuse to let the insult stand. \"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood. \"I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message. Ah, you again is it? The recusants sent a lackey. Can you believe they invited me to join them? Now! After what they did. . . I can scarcely believe it myself. Do they think me a fool?You might be surprised to learn I took them up on the offer. Then I only had to ask. The location of the recusant hideout. It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west from the town of windmills. That's where they hide. The manor on the peak. Just you wait, wretched recusants. You'll rue the day you insulted my name by laying hands on Lanya. \"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood\" after all. Ah. Oh. . . I-it's you is it? Well. Nice to see you again. So you've been invited as well, I see. Then we're comrades in arms, henceforth. You watch my back, and I'll watch yours, yes?I, um. . . I can tell. . . You're wondering about Lanya. . . Well, you see, I. . . After much internal debate. I've come to realise. . . Revenge is not the answerAccording to Lady Tanith. . . I've got the stuff of champions. And champions, ironic as it is, are oft forced walk a tainted a path. It hit me like a bolt from the blue. . . That my former thoughts were simple naivet\u00e9. Of course, my heart weeps for Lanya. That unfortunate incident was a cruel twist of fate indeed. But succumbing to the pain and sadness caused won't make me a champion, will it. Lanya knows this, I'm certain. Fate has laid hard roads for us both. But such is true of any road trod by champions. I always resented these hands. Their pale complexion, a far cry from any warrior's. The shame of House Hoslow. But that won't be the case for long. They'll be darkened by grit, once I've set out on the path of champions. \"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood\" after all. It's just as my noble brother says. I'm a complete fool. I can't believe I thought I could become a champion. Ah, it's you is it. I'm terribly sorry, but would you mind giving me some time to myself. I haven't achieved anything at all thus far. Even though I've dirtied my hands time and time again. I'm still yet to achieve anything. Perhaps I am a fool after all. . . No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the path of revenge and sullied the name of my house. What an easy mark I must have been. . . How did it take me so long to realise, honestly. There's just no end to my foolishness, is there. . . Well. Aren't you full of beans. No wonder you're covered in muck. Oh? My friend, it's been far too long. I have to say you caught me at a rather low point. But. . . as you can see, I've put all that behind me. Left the Volcano Manor. Forging my own path now. Making my own choices. Even a fool like me can look after some simply jars. Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time in my life I'm on the straight and narrow. . . . Ah, you. . . Are the jars. . . they alright? Did I defend them?Then all is well. . . This fool proved his worth, in the end. . . Ha ha. . . ha. . . I see. . . I see. . . I've been a fool. . . to the last. . . Agh! What on earth was that for?Now I see. You're a wretched recusant! May you rue the day that you thought to trample me! The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood! In blood! Lanya, your honour has been restored. You can rest easy. When attacked at Jarburg Ugh! What's the matter? Please, stop! I've no quarrel with the Volcano Manor. I will never brandish a sword again, I swear! Why on earth. . . ? Wait, you're a poacher, aren't you? I'll turn my back on duty no more. The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood! In blood!

When I'm not hotfooting it from the troops, that is. But enough about me, what are you doing here in Stormveil Castle?This place is bristling with Tarnished hunters, you know. They sacrifice our kind, for grafting. Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind. . . You can see it then, I take it? The guidance of grace. Well, enjoy it while you can. I'm Tarnished, like you. But unlike you, I've seen neither hide nor hair of this guidance for the longest time. Still, I won't forget how it felt when I first came here, to the Lands Between. I'm privy to a few magical battle arts. Would you care to learn one? As a fellow Tarnished, once guided by grace, I'd love to help you out, if it please. Ah, we meet again after all. I apologize for any offence given by my bearing, but I'm quite unable to move, you see. So. What do you need?Ah, you defeated Godrick and claimed yourself a Great Rune. Mm, looks like we both got what we wanted out of Stormveil, didn't we. Well done, friend. Something to mark the occasion. Go on, take it. As you might've guessed, I still can't move. My fighting days are behind me. No need to be polite, I've no use for it anymore. The misshapen corpse under Stormveil? That is a sacred relic. Of the black knives plot. As that famed night of assassination is known. It happened during the Golden Age of the Erdtree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring. Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade. And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden. That was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history. And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering. I once wished to become a scholar, you see. I've spent many an hour scouring the archives for knowledge of that fateful plot. The world has grown crooked, and if you intend to put it to rights, you'd better understand what happened to make it this way, mm?And. . . that thing is to blame for the shape I'm in now. . . I urge the utmost caution. Don't disturb the corpse more than necessary. . . This. . . is a black knifeprint! I can scarcely believe you managed to get your hands on this!You recall our conversation about the Night of the Black Knives, yes? They say the assassins who carried out the deed were scions of the Eternal City. A group entirely of women, arrayed in armour of silver under cloaks which fooled the eye. The knives they wielded though, were imparted with the power of the Rune of Death through sinister rite. Please, I beg of you, lend me the knifeprint for a time. I'd love nothing more than to tease out its secrets. Though only a fragment, a very specific ritual had to be performed to impart the power of the Rune of Death. Traces of the one who performed the rite are sure to remain in the imprint. . . Half my body has been suffused with Death. I'm certain it will help me see. Ahh, hello. I was hoping to see you. My examination is complete. Here's the knifeprint back, with my thanks. Now, I have a fairly good idea who performed the rite upon the blade. The person who orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives. Lunar Princess Ranni. One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Rennala. Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard. Her's was the name I discovered in the imprint. Truly, you have my thanks. But, if I might be so bold, I would also like to ask something more of you. If Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night, then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh. I would like you to procure it for me. And then all will be laid bare. I will have the answers I have sought for so long. I'm afraid there's something I must tell you. Do you know of Those Who Live in Death?The very notion of life in death defies the Golden Order. By D's account, these defiled fiends must be expunged. But truth be told, I seek the cursemark to save them. You may find this peculiar,but I discovered something in my examination of the Night of the Black Knives. These souls have committed no offence. They have every right to life, only, they happened to touch upon a flaw in the Order. I see. . . When Ranni shed her flesh, she shed the cursemark, too. You know, not everyone would trust such a tale. . . But, if she in her current form is nothing more than the living doll you profess. . . Then perhaps it's true after all. Hmm.\u00a0Forgive the bluntness of the notion, but. . . How would you like to become one of Ranni's vassals?Ah, only in order to get what we want, of course. The location of the body which bore the cursemark, which right now I haven't the faintest. And the best way to find out is for you to enter her service and take a poke around on the sly. I know you've got what it takes. Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it. Can you become Ranni's vassal to advance our agenda?While in her service, you'll be able to take a poke around on the sly. And determine the location of her original body that bears the cursemark. I realise that I'm asking you to put yourself in grave danger. But I know you've got what it takes. Quite possibly the only one, in fact. Hmm. Maybe I should tell you. Lately, I feel I'm on the precipice. . . Of falling into a deep. . . fathomless slumber. And I have an inkling it could spell trouble for you, somehow. So I just wanted to get the apology out of the way, beforehand. Since you're so scary and all. Ah, so you've met D. D is an old friend. We found ourselves journeying together for a time, bound by our exploration of Death. But our paths since diverged. Never again to cross. Though that's hardly an uncommon fate for two friends. D was telling me. That he discovered the mark of the centipede. The centipede is an ancient symbol of the cursemark. As long as whoever finds and uses it is not nefarious by nature, then we may be able to form an alliance. If only I could speak to them in person. And if they were like you, all the better. Yes, indeed. If D knew what drives me now, he would surely boil over with rage. Or perhaps, he would even feel some pity. But no need to fret, none of that will come to pass. I can tell a good lie when I need to. Always good to see you safe. So. What do you need?They were conceived at the great Academy of Raya Lucaria, to the north of this castle. In the past, they obeyed laws which contravened the Golden Order, or so I'm told. Fascinating, isn't it? That the Golden Order was pliable enough to absorb practices that contradicted itself in the past. With the Order broken, twisted, and in need of repair, such adaptability is more important now than ever.\u00a0",

I don't know what it is the mistress sees in a provincial Tarnished like you,but since we have the misfortune of serving the same Lady,I ask that you kindly try not to drag us all down with you. I reside. . . in another tower, close by. Come and pay me a visit. . . Should you wish to be of actual service to Mistress Ranni. If it were up to me, I wouldn't waste my time on the likes of you. But who am I to stand against the wishes of my Lady?Well, well. You took me at my word. Did you not realise I was merely being polite? You provincials never cease to amaze. . . Hmm, I suppose you're here now. Perhaps I'll give you something to do. I'd like you to find a woman called Nepheli, to administer a potion. Even you can do that much, can't you?[Accept the task]Good, good. Now I shall hand over the potion in question. [Receives Seluvis's Potion]Find Nepheli, and ensure she drinks it. I except glad tidings. And soon. Well, well. You're asking me about that, are you?The task was left to you and the mongrel, was it not?Not only are you incompetent, but shameless to boot. Well. . . there's no helping it. Now's as good a time as any. I'll let you in on it. There's a glintstone sorcerer by the name of Sellen in Limgrave. She owes me for the help I gave her when she was expelled from the academy. I asked her to look into the matter some time ago. I'll write you a letter of introduction. Go ask her. Ahh, so you made Nepheli drink the potion?Well done. You are a touch more useful than I had thought. Very well. Then you shall have your gift. Knowledge of the sorcerous arts, under the tutelage of the great Preceptor Seluvis. I doubt much of it will lay within the grasp of a mere Tarnished, but. . . If you put your mind to it, perhaps you won't embarrass our Lady. You wish to begin right this moment?Well, your impatience, though boorish, is understandable. Let's have at it. Hmm. Is that a scroll?I won't bother to ask where you pilfered it, but. . . You're correct to assume I'm one of the few who can decipher it. So, I'm perfectly happy to take it off your hands. That said, don't you dare get your hopes up. More often than not, new knowledge is merely an opportunity to reflect. . . . . . upon the mediocrity of one's intellect. So, you had Nepheli drink the potion? Truly?Hmm. Then perhaps something was amiss with it. It's concocted from the finest ingredients. But perhaps I should review the recipe. I may have expected too much of her, to begin with. You break into a man's private chambers, rooting about as you please?Your oafishness knows no bounds. Fine and well. You tricked Nepheli, and had her drink the potion. I believe that makes you my accomplice. You yearn for a puppet of your own, hmm?Well, normally one of your stature would never be allowed. But perhaps I can make a very special exception. Now, choose. How's the puppet I gave you? A thing of exquisite craft, is it not?What's that? You want another puppet?Quite the keen paramour, aren't we. But, I'm afraid each and every one is like a child to me. I can hardly just give them away. Oh dear, what's to be done?Why don't you. . . fetch me some starlight shards?If you can manage it, I'll gladly prepare a new puppet for you. The soul of every puppet has its own ambience. You'll soon come to know, once you possess a few. And once each's predilections are known to you, the better you'll be able to love them. Oh yes, you have much to look forward to, further down this road. You're proving to be quite the puppeteer. I've not had an apprentice for. . . a very long time indeed. Perhaps, you'd be interested in a little scheme of mine?It will produce the finest of puppets. Which I aspire to cherish with these very hands. A ploy to fool even Lady Ranni. . . How does that sound? Ahh, I knew I had you pegged. You're just like me. Then I'd like you to procure something. A rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber. With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness. And even a demigod would be slave to its charms. . . Very good. A wise choice, indeed. You passed my little test with flying colours. I was merely gauging your loyalty to Lady Ranni. Well done, I'm very proud of you. Let's both do our utmost in service of our Lady.\u00a0Ah ha. Might you be interested after all?

You'll be flabbergasted, I can assure you. The secret* I promised is to be revealed very shortly. . . Good, I've been waiting for you. It's finally complete.

Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona. . . she's a frail, gentle girl at heart. You. . . understand, don't you?That once you have Ranni drink my draught, my scheme will come to fruition. And we, well, we'll be in a position to claim the very finest puppet ever crafted. Just imagine. . . the pure elation. . . Agh! Enough of that, now. Have you forgotten that we both serve the same Lady?You incorrigible lout. Don't you\u00a0dare\u00a0waltz back here again.

You may let down your guard. Allow me a word of advice, as your senior.\u00a0You are a mere visitor to the Roundtable, nothing more. A house guest, yet to earn their keep.\u00a0Remember your place, newcomer. There's nothing left to say. Be at your leisure. \"What do you need? I have little time to spare\". \"Oh, are you aggrieved? At the notion you are but a visitant here?Then you would do well to remember the first words of grace given to you. Stand before the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord. If those words held any meaning to you. . . Follow the guidance of grace, lay low the shardbearers, and claim for yourself a Great Rune. Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber\u00a0will open. And you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers. \"Once the wisdom of the Two Fingers becomes your own, I'll impart to you a proper welcome. As a true member of the Roundtable.\u00a0I have high hopes for you\". I'm sick and tired of them.\u00a0These namby-pamby Tarnished think us no more than a shelter from the rain. . . \"We've spoken long enough. I have matters to attend to\". You've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers, have you not? Then, just as promised, I bid you welcome, as a true member of the Roundtable. I am known as Gideon Ofnir. As a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord, I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing. You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant. You'll be after more Great Runes, now eh? Then as your fellow, allow me to divulge a little knowledge. The inheritors of the Great Runes; the shardbearers. We of the Roundtable know the location of five of them, including the one you defeated. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil. General Radahn, who fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds. Praetor Rykard, Lord of the Volcano Manor of Mt. Gelmir. Morgott the Grace-Given, Veiled Monarch and Lord of Leyndell. And Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, ruler of Raya Lucaria's Academy. . . . You'll still be after more Great Runes, won't you?So. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil. Despite being the blood of Godfrey, first Elden Lord, he's a grotesque old fool, grasping for power. His castle lies upon the cliff to Limgrave's northwest, but I suspect you know that well enough already. General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior. He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east. And now Caelid has been engulfed by the scarlet rot, even approaching the region is no mean feat. I've heard survivors of Radahn's army are still in the wilds, staving off the rot with fire. And if it's true, I suspect Radahn is still there as well, in Caelid. Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore. . . Praetor Rykard is the Lord of the Volcano Manor on Mt. Gelmir. He is a ruthless justiciar who commands a company of inquisitors, reviled for his serpentine demeanour. The volcano, Mt. Gelmir, lies in the west of the Altus Plateau; the realm of the Erdtree. It was the stage of the most appalling battle in the entirety of the Shattering. Rykard has commited the grave sin of blasphemy. Marking himself as an enemy, never to be forgiven. Morgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city. It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau. But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there. Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to\u00a0repair the Elden Ring. Set your sights elsewhere for the time being. The Veiled Monarch can wait. The Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia. Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy. But Rennala herself is no demigod. Her beloved, Radagon, left her to become Queen Marika's second husband, taking the title of King Consort. The Great Rune dwells withing the amber egg that was Radagon's gift to her. I understand you've been speaking to Nepheli. She is my daughter. I took her in when she lost the guidance of grace. Tough a mere axe-wielding barbarian, her youthful credulity suited my purposes. So I put her to work. Do not hesitate to employ her, should her services benefit you. Despite her looks, she is more than capable in the press of battle.\u00a0[After beating the Omenkiller in Albinauric Village] Ahh, you've already heard? Indeed, it seemed the whelp harboured suspicions. So I have no further use for her. Honestly, what's a man to do. A determined plebian is more wicked than an Omen horn, quite frankly. I suspect. . . that's just what the Queen wants. A dose of ambition, to incite the Tarnished. Is that potion what I think it is? Bloody Seluvis. I suppose he's up to something again. Oh, I won't interfere. You go ahead and do what you must. The Roundtable has no code to speak of.\u00a0 But, I ask you this. Are you really going to do the bidding of that twisted dolly botherer?Or would you rather hand that potion to me, and see if we can't get one over on the bastard?[Hand over Seluvis's Potion] Good. I'll dispose of the potion myself. You go and see Seluvis, but don't give anything away. Just tell him that you tricked your mark into drinking the potion as planned. Despite knowing next to bloody nothing, he's so far up his own arse he won't suspect a thing. His inevitable display of arrogance will certainly be a sight to behold. [Don't hand it over] Well, I won't force you. But I think your plan would be a dreadful waste. She's not herself right now, and though I have no need for her, she still has potential. Certainly more value than she'd have as a bloody puppet. Oh, my apologies for that nasty business. Ensha got rather ahead of himself, it seems. As his master, I'd like to express my regret. But now, Ensha is slain and gone. Finished, forever more.\u00a0Ah, yes, by way of apology, allow me to tender some advice, in regard to the half of the secret medallion you possess. Find the Albinauric woman. She hides in a cave to the west of the Laskyar Ruins which jut from the mist-shrouded lake of Liurnia. She knows the location of the medallion's counterpart, I am sure. Well. I see you've found another Great Rune.\u00a0Wonderful. You are a worthy fellow Tarnished, indeed. Make the journey.\u00a0To the capital Leyndell, that lies to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree. The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer.\u00a0You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring. For we are Tarnished. And we must answer the call of grace. \"If you're heading to the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants. You'll need to find the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region. Go, if you would. Take no heed of \"cardinal sin\". The Two Fingers lost their purpose a long, long time ago. \"\"There are four more demigods yet to be located. Miquella of the Haligtree, the Unalloyed. His twin, Malenia, the undefeated swordswoman. Lunar Princess Ranni, daughter to Rennala. And the one only known as the Lord of Blood. Ranni is said to have cast aside her Great Rune, so here at the Hold, we seek the whereabouts of the remaining three shardbearers. If you should learn anything of these matters, I'll trade your findings for a hidden treasure, or a long-lost rite, known only to me. We both desire to stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord. As such, I hope we are compelled to work together. \"I hear you helped get the girl back on her feet. Though I'm not her foster father anymore, I'd still like to thank you. Sorry. For the time you had to waste. Ahh, I see you've laid your hands on the other secret medallion. I'm glad to see my counsel has borne fruit, but the honour of the deed is yours alone. You've made more of yourself than Ensha has. . . Now, more importantly, both secret medallions are in your hands. I suppose you'd like to know then? What awaits you on the path ahead?Me too, my friend, me too. I wait with baited breath. Ahh, so the secret medallion led you to the land of the Haligtree?I'd expect to find Malenia there. She who fought Radahn to a standstill. Well, if the scarlet rot hasn't eaten her away completely. But. . . with the Haligtree as it is. . . I suppose Miquella must already be. . . Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there. The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:A secret rite known only to me. You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant. So. The Haligtree, now but a husk. . . I heard speculation Miquella embedded himself in the Haligtree,but before he could finish, someone cut the tree open and absconded with his infant form. Indeed, it seems those words held weight. How vexing. That the All-knowing didn't have the full story. . . Perhaps the Queen's sorrow was justified. . .\u00a0Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there. The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:A secret rite known only to me. You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant. Oh, so that's where the so-called Lord of Blood was hiding himself eh. A fitting little squat for that deluded maniac to bleat about the revival of his precious dynasty, while he turns our fellow Tarnished into Bloody Fingers. Let him stay there. That way, his delusions will remain as the are - distant and unattainable. But perhaps it's worth looking into. . . If what I've heard is right, then maybe. . . Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there. The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:A secret rite known only to me. You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant. Ahh, I see! So Miquella was with the Lord of Blood after all! That is some fine intelligence indeed!With it, the final clue has been brought into the light. One of the last few pieces the Roundtable-- I need, to put everything together. As promised, allow me to impart to you the last of the secret rites known only to me. Well I wonder what comes next. . . If he continues his slumber within the cocoon, all will be well. But perhaps it would be safer to destroy it. Miquella is the one thing that remains a mystery to me. . . You. . . burned the Erdtree, didn't you? Then the Roundtable is soon to follow. Ah, no need to fret about that. The Roundtable Hold served to put a Tarnished upon the throne of Elden Lord. And if the Erdtree needed to burn for that to happen, then the Roundtable must go as well. I'll stay at the Roundtable, for a time. I must learn all that can be taken from this place, and sear it into my memory. How could I call myself the All-Knowing if I did any less?The pursuit of knowledge is without end, for knowledge is never a thing complete. Thus, I maintain the mantle of All-Knowing. Perhaps the same could be said about guidance. Who's to say whether we'll remain who we are, once the fight is finished?What do you think, as one who aspires to become Elden Lord?",

I journey to the east, where I intend to further my education in the ways of war. Beyond these lands lie the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds. And upon their southern edge is Redmane Castle, in which a festival of combat is being held. I'd heard whispers of such festivities before. . .\u00a0Doesn't the notion set your breast aflutter!Ha ha ha ha!\"I'm heading eastward.\u00a0To Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds. I've heard there's to be a festival held there. Oh I hadn't expected to see your face again. Are you heading to the festival of combat, too?Oh, no need to be coy with me. Judging by the fine wallop you gave the old backside earlier, I would venture you're something of a warrior yourself. The mere thought of such a festival gets the blood pumping, eh!Now, now, according to my calculations, passing through this road should lead us to the Caelid Wilds. But however you slice it, it seems we've reached a dead end. I'm sorry to have raised your hopes. It seems my calculations must have been off. . . I was created to be a warrior vessel. Many great warriors reside within me, ever dreaming of becoming a great champion. It's my destiny. And the reason for which I quest. It is my ordeal, you could say. To test myself, to better myself, to fell ever greater foes. And then, one day, we'll be a single great champion. The greatest of them all!What do you think, eh? How do you rate my changes?Heh heh. . . . . . !The esteemed warrior. Where did you spring from? This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it. What's going on here? A door, from thin air! Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward! To the Caelid Wilds. Gosh, that dead-end had me rather stumped! Heh. . . heh. . It's time I set off. To the festival al \u00a0on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds. Doesn't the thought just set your heart aflutter!Ah, you came, how delightful! Indeed, I thought I might find you here. By the by, do you know for whom this festival is being held? Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself!To think, I could face a great champion of the Shattering, a demigod in the flesh. . . In truth I quiver at the thought, such is his frightful repute. But! The fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking!Now, be sure to get a good vantage, my friend. I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal. A-ah, hello there. It was a battle marvellously fought. You are well and truly a champion, friend. I, on the other hand, am nothing but a crock. One hit was all it took to crack me, and for my insides to come spilling out. After that, I hid like a coward. And as such, I can hardly stand to face one such as you. . . . But don't you think I've given up just yet. As luck would have it, there's a veritable mountain of warriors' bodies right here. If I can just squeeze this bunch down inside me, I'll be a mighty warrior again in no time. And you know. . . The bodies found here are exceedingly fine. Who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the Shattering, the greatest of all wars!Just you wait and see, friend. I'll grow even stronger! Just you wait, when next we meet! Heh heh. . . Hello-o? Can you hear me? Help me! I'm stuck. Hello? Hellooo! Anyone! Ahh, hello! How nice it is to see a friendly face! As you can surmise, I've got myself stuck in another hole. Would you mind helping me out, again?\u00a0My thanks in advance, I know you're the man for the job! You know what to do, hm?Give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big. Don't worry about my wound sustained at the festival. I'm stuck back together good and proper! Just give it your all!Come on, give me a good smack from behind with something nice ang big!I see. More's the pity. No no. I apologise. Don't you worry about a thing. Despite my appearance. I am but a chip off a greater jar. I'll pop out eventually.\u00a0 What's that look, good sir? Are you willing to help me after all? Ah! P-please! Wait. I have a terrible feeling about this! Would you stop hitting me for a minute! Argh! Cease! Please! Just stop a moment, I beg!\u00a0 I'll break! I'll break before i'm out!\u00a0 G-good gosh, stop, please! That's my face! Smack me from the other end! The other end!I can feel my lower half is stuck on something. I don't think you can get me out just by hitting me, this time. Hmm. . . Let's think. . . Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly. . . What if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch?\u00a0 By the gods you are a man of vision! This will have me as slippery as a toad. I have a good feeling about this, my friend. Right! Give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big!Nngh! Oh, yes! That's the ticket!My thanks! To you and your razor-sharp wits. As a token of my thanks, I'd like you to have this. Deary me, I'm oilier than a toad! There were countless oil jars back where I'm from actually. And now I know what it's like to be one of them! Heh heh. . . Yes, indeed, I too have a home. Though it is one to which I have vowed not to return. So, I thought I might look out from atop the cliff, but as I drew closer and closer. . . Pow! Wouldn't you know it, I was perfectly stuck in that blasted hole. I can feel the warriors inside admonishing me for my mawkishness. To walk the path of champions, one cannot cleave to the past!I'm headed to the fiery mount in the north. I can strengthen myself there, without fear of cracking this vessel. I will forge myself anew in its flames!Ngh! Rnnngh! O mountain of fire! Bake me in your flames!Nnngh! Ah, good lady\/sir, what business might you have in such a place as this?I hardly think you're here to temper yourself with flame, considering that flesh form of yours. Your timing though, is impeccable as ever! I've been making just the thing for you on my journey here. Take it, I'm sure it'll suit you to a tee. But oh, it's hardly more than lukewarm here. I won't be able to temper my body such that it'll never crack again. Perhaps I'll head eastward. There's an old saying I've caught wind of. \"Above the lofty clouds, the icy giant's peak doth soar, here lieth the flame of ruin, which ever burning roars. \"Ah, I see you've finally made it here yourself. The city hanging in the air is slowly crumbling. What an incredible place we find ourselves. But that aside, you're certainly a force to be reckoned with, eh. I doubt there's a single soul who could've handled that giant, other than you. It was practically a god. . . Of course I count myself, the great Alexander, among the many. Which means, I've but one thing to ask of you. Would you kindly undertake my ordeal?Come and tell me when you're ready. I've been longing to fight a warrior as accomplished as you. You are ready then, I take it? Then let us begin! I am the great jar warrior, Iron Fist Alexander! Lend me strength, O warriors within! Let us become one champion, together!As I suspected. . . Victory. . . was impossible. This vessel. . . was found lacking. . . My thanks, I knew you were the stuff of champions. It was a marvellous battle. I implore you, take what I bequeath. . . from inside me. . . All vessels are destined to one day break. But the great Alexander lived as a warrior to his last! Ha ha ha ha!",

The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way. . . Please, I must have the necklace back. Please, stop, Brave Tarnished. You will only tire by striking this barrier. Besides I'm no foe of yours. Please think this over. I see you've reconsidered. Thank goodness. Oh, yes, that is my missing necklace.\u00a0Thank you kindly. I am in your debt. Did I forget to announce myself?I am Rya, in the service of Lady Tanith of the Volcano Manor. I seek stalwart Tarnished who might join our house.\u00a0You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand,but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind.\u00a0Such strength is precisely what my mistress seeks. Please, take this. Brave Tarnished, seek the Altus Plateau, the realm of the Erdtree. Most Tarnished are Doomed to wander the outskirts of the Lands Between, peering wistfully at the towering Erdtree. . . But you are no ordinary Tarnished. And once that is proven,the Volcano Manor will fully extend its invitation. To fight, amongst a family of champions. Ohh, and. . . One more thing, only for you. . . This land of Liurnia is connected to the Altus Plateau by the Grand Lift of Dectus, beyond the High Road. But the lift has been defunct for an age, meaning there's no simple means of you must seek the old ruins in the cliff. At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel. It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau. I have faith in you, A champion, through and throught. I do hope that we can meet again. Hello again. Brave Tarnished. As a scout, I am pleased to see you again here at the Volcano Manor. Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour. Hello again. Brave Tarnished. It is a shame that I did not beckon you here with my own hand, but I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor. Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour. A pleasure to meet you. Brave Tarnished. I am Rya, the scout. Very pleased to welcome you to the Volcano Manor. Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour. Have you ever. . . heard any strange sounds here at the manor?Something beyond the walls, like breathing, or slithering scales. . . Oh fie what am I saying? It just isn't possible. I must be tired. Sometimes I hear strange sounds beyond the walls. Like breathing, or slithering scales. Oh, perhaps I'm just feeling tired. Brave Tarnished, what is your business here? I'm afraid this is not a guest room. What's that peculiar look upon your face?Goodness, am I still a serpent? Oh, how dreadful. . . How dreadful indeed. . . Forgive my distress. I ought to be thanking you\u00a0for treating me as usual, despite this appearance. Brave Tarnished. This is my true form. My real name is Zorayas. Please forgive the deception. Do understand. The duplicity is my own doing. Lady Tanith speaks no falsehoods, and the Volcano Manor is just as it seems. Lady Tanith is my mother. I am told I was born by the grace of a glorious king. That my mother cherishes this form I inhabit. I am proud of what I am. But people are cruel. If they saw my true form, the wouldn't speak to me. And so I assume a guise when seeking new recruits. But you are not like the rest.\u00a0My serpentine form, and the name Zorayas, were secrets known only to Lady Tanith and I. Now I share the secrets with you, as well. Please keep them safe from anyone else. Um, oh, it's you. Forgive me. My mind never ceases to churn of late. Hmm, well. . . I know I can trust you. . . I saw something, slithering in the pitch black of night. It entered the room next to this one, and never came out. If I'm not mistaken, it took the form of a serpent, just like me. . . Does the Volcano Manor hide some secret, that Lady Tanith has kept from me?I realise that I shouldn't impose but, if you discover anything, would you please share?Really. . . Oh, so there was a secret after all. . . Oh my. . . Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me. . . Was I not. . . born by the grace of a king?I remember this scent, distinctly. Funny, isn't it. I am certain of it. I was born inside this. It's a part of my birth mother. You have my gratitude. Thanks to you, I am no longer afraid. I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith. One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart. Oh, it's you. . . I'm afraid. . . there is something I must tell you. I was an unwanted child. Born not of grace, but of a hideous ritual. Something that can never be accepted, not by men, nor serpents. Even Lady Tanith shouldn't accept me. I know that you have done so much for me. But I wish to ask one last kindness. Kill me, please. I thought that I feared nothing. But this. . . Free me from this accursed frame. Agh. . . Thank you. . . My champion. . . Mother. . . Yes, of course. You always were very kind. Ahh. . . How delightfully sweet. . . And yet. . . Oh, it's you. Heaven knows what happened here, but Lady Tanith, and all the Tarnished champions, are gone. It feels rather quiet without them. But with you here, things will be just fine. I await Lady Tanith. I am her daughter, born by the grace of a great king. I do not wish to burden her, or cause concern. Brave Tarnished. Do tread the path of valour. I'm certain that this is what Lady Tanith wishes. You're not willing to kill me, are you. Hah. . .

Well, your aptitude does appear. . . passable. But one must choose one's masters wisely. I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria, as a reviled, apostate witch. Do you still wish to learn from me?Well, you are a piece of work. Very well. You are now my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in glintstone sorcery. But I refuse to coddle. Or cast kind words. Never. Anticipate\u00a0grievances, young apprentice. Young apprentice, first things first. You are a tadpole when it comes to magic. Infantile. Without the legs to walk. So, to become a sorcerer, first, you must face your ignorance. Now, shall we start learning?Our powers draw upon the powers embedded in glintstone, but what is the nature of such power? Glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, golden amber contains the remnants of ancient life and houses its vitality, while Glintstone contains residual life. And thus, the vitality of the stars. It should not be forgotten that glintstone sorcery is the study of the stars and the life therin. Oh, is that a scroll? Takes me back to my academy days. Very well. This is sorcery with which I'm not entirely unfamiliar. I'll be sure to incorporate it into one of your lessons. Never lose that inquisitive spirit, my apprentice. It will do no good, I swear it. . . and yet you persist, you frothing degenerates. . . A. . . argh!Well, well. . . Seluvis is not a name I ever wanted to hear again. . . But, fine. If it will help you, my apprentice, I offer my knowledge. The stars alter the fate of the Carian royal family. And the fate of your mistress, Ranni. But long ago, General Radahn challenged the swirling constellations, and in a crushing victory, arrested their cycles. Now, he is the force that repulses the stars. If General Radahn were to die, the stars would resume their movement. And so, too, would Ranni's destiny. Ah, then you have seen Master Azur. Master Azur was a founding glintstone sorcerer, and my first teacher. A stern judge of men, but he must have seen something in you. You make us both proud. We can speak more later, my apprentice. If you recall, I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria. It was for attempting to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. The toothless pedantry peddled by the Carian royal family can rot for all I care. I want glintstone sorceries that open our minds, unbound by terrestrial taboos. No matter what we give in return. My apprentice. I presume nothing. Teacher and student are not bound to tread the same path. But hear me out, my apprentice. I need your help to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. Perhaps this is a journey we could take together?Splendid. I thank you. This pleases me. It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit. You must have a fabulous teacher. I need your help, my apprentice. Master Lusat is another founding glintstone sorcerer. And like Master Azur, he was banished from the academy. Now he languishes, imprisoned somewhere. My apprentice, can you find Master Lusat? With this glintstone key, you should be able to cross the boundary that encloses him. I need him to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. He's nigh a child of the stars, such is his body now. . . After his expulsion from the academy, I heard that Master Lusat returned to his home. A place called Sellia, in the eastern Caelid Wilds. Thinking about it, I obtained the glintstone key I gave you from a Sellian sorcerer. It wouldn't be too much of a leap to suppose he's still cooped up nearby. My apprentice. Give me a moment later. I have a favour to ask. Who could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat. . . You have my gratitude. This is all your work. I am truly pleased to have you as an apprentice, and a kindred spirit. This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it. This brings us a full step closer. The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the academy. If only I could undo these wretched shackles. . . The form you see before you is merely a projection. My body lies elsewhere. But the academy's shackles prevent it being moved. My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between, imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum. Can you make the journey to my body? I have something that I can only trust with you.\u00a0My apprentice, thank you for coming. These shackles take a toll on us all. There is something I need you to look after. My primal glintstone. A star has fallen, and my fortunes waver. someone may come for my life. And so, I entrust it with you. My self. Thank you. . . my apprentice. . . This. . . is my essence. Please, treat it with care. Treat it with care, my apprentice. . . What you hold is my very being. . . My apprentice, just how long has it been? Thank you. You've helped me fill a new body, once again. And it's truly a gem. Young and full of vigor, a snug fit for my Primal Glintstone. Better still, I've shed those awful shackles. Finally, I can return to the academy. To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current. My dear apprentice, I owe this all to you. Jerren, bringer of my death. You have my gratitude. For freeing me from my shackles. But I am afraid your work is done. Join the school. To reflect on your mistake. Ahh, my apprentice. You've saved my skin once again. Do you see this? The Queen of Caria is no more. With the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat returned, the academy can hone the primeval current. So that we, fallen children of the stars, shall beam with brilliance once again. My apprentice. Will you stay with us, here at the academy?Oh, I know it's not possible. You have your own calling. To be the next Elden Lord. But do think of me. Of your teacher. On the eve of your crowning. You will always be my darling pupil. Rest assured that I. . . No, the entire academy, will swear allegiance to the new monarch. My apprentice. Become Elden Lord. Hmm. Perhaps I'm jumping ahead,but here is a symbol of my allegiance, and the academy's. (gives )Do you recall what I once told you?That glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, and sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein. When you become Elden Lord, please illuminate me. Lay bare the secrets of life which course the Elden Ring. Next time, I will be your student. Oh, one last thing. If you fail to claim your throne,you can always pay me a visit. Oh, don't fret.
